# Country Flags Collection

This repository provides a curated subset of country flags based on the [hampusborgos/country-flags](https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags) project.

The focus is on countries that are either:

- part of the **IOC (International Olympic Committee)**, and
- commonly associated with **Europe in an international sporting context** (e.g. European Championships).

The flags are prepared in line with common **IOC protocol conventions**, especially in terms of visual presentation and naming. The collection is not officially affiliated with the IOC or any sports organization.

## Contents

- **Formats**:  
  Flags are available in both **SVG** (vector) and **PNG** (bitmap) formats.

- **Orientations**:  
  Each flag may exist in two variants:

  - **Landscape** (horizontal)
  - **Portrait** (vertical)

- **Style Variants**:  
  Each flag can be available in two different styles:

  - **Official**: Based on the official national design, using the country's standard proportions.
  - **Standardized**: Adjusted to a **uniform aspect ratio** (3:2) for consistent display across different flags.

- **Metadata**:  
  A JSON file (`metadata.json`) provides metadata for each country. Countries are identified by their **IOC codes** (International Olympic Committee country codes).

- **Naming Convention**:  
  Files are named using the country code, style, and orientation, for example:
  - `GER_official_landscape.svg`
  - `GER_standardized_landscape.png`
  - `GER_official_portrait.svg`
  - `GER_standardized_portrait.png`

## Usage

The flags and metadata can be used in projects that require visual or contextual representations of countries, such as:

- Applications
- Websites
- Protocol documentation
- Event materials (esp. sport-related)

Please note:

- The selection of countries is intentionally limited and tailored to European participation in international sports.
- Some flags may exist only in selected styles or orientations.
- Flags and Metadata is provided without guarantee of accuracy.
